# Web-scrapping-for-TripAdvisor-Reviews

##### In this project, I worked with a client from Freelancer platform to scrap travellers reviews and ratings for a List of current National Football League stadiums from Trip Advisor Website. Those location are mentioned in the link below from Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums

##### In this repo you will find three main files: a folder containing snapshot of the list of locations (taken from Wikipedia), Python script (with an example links from trip advisor), and folder with the outcome results (Excel files containing the review information such as the name of the reviewer, rating, data of the review, title of the review, and the description of the review)

##### The libraries used are: Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas
